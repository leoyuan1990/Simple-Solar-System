# Simple-Solar-System
A simple, mostly to scale model of our solar system done in C++ using OpenGL. A better version will be uploaded soon with focus on improving the UI and visual appeal.

 Click the window to begin. Start orbiting the planets by holding 'a' or 'd'. Zooming in and out are possible by holding 'w' or 's' keys respectively. Speed up or slow down the orbital speeds by holding 'z' or 'c' respectively. Right click to bring up the quick zoom and quick speed menus. You can also quit the program by pressing q.
